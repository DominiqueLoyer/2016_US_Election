##### Prediction
Clearly, we see that overall, that day around 1:00, roughly 7 hours before the NY Times comfirmed the winner, I was able to state with a rather high confidence that Trump was going to win
to win the election considering that the polarity of surprise (emotion) was about twice as much for Trump vs. Clinton.
